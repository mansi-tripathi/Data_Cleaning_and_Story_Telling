We can never undermine the importance of data cleaning and data science storytelling and this folder is dedicated to just that

## Data Cleaning and its Importance
- Data cleaning is also important because it improves your data quality and in doing so, increases overall productivity. When you clean your data, all outdated or incorrect information is gone – leaving you with the highest quality information. This ensures your team do not have to wade through countless outdated documents and allows employees to make the most of their work hours
- It removes major errors and inconsistencies that are inevitable when multiple sources of data are getting pulled into one dataset.
- Data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning data rather than creating insights.

Steps involved in Data cleaning are as follows:
a. Monitor Errors
b. Standardize the processes
c. Validate Accuracy
d. Check for duplicate data and remove it
e. Analyze the data
f. Provide insights

## Data Science Storytelling and its Importance
- Data Storytelling is a very critical skill for Data Scientists that find little mention. It is nothing but the art of weaving a coherent story around the numbers that convey the logic, strike the right chord with the stakeholders and convince them with reasons appropriate enough to drive a decision. A data scientist’s motive is to ensure that the actions are taken on the insights that he/she has drawn from the data. This depends a lot on how well he has presented the data to the end-users or decision makers. Data Storytelling is all about presenting the right information in an appropriate format at the most opportune time.
-Storytelling is not as easy as it appears. It takes a great deal of visualization, creativity and good presentation skills to ace the art of Data Storytelling. Most Data Scientists are trained to just stick to numbers and analytical skills and are not quite aware of the requirement to weave a good narrative around their analysis. However, it does pay to develop this critical skill because it adds a great deal of value to your analysis. Good Storytelling only helps decision makers to make sense of your analysis faster, be fully convinced with your findings and forecasts, and take the right course of action at the right time.


Since now you may have understood the importance of data science storytelling, here are two videos that demonstrate my data storytelling abilities in way that it can be understood by anyone even though they might not be familar with the data science terms and jargons.
